Next we have pull request where actual added code is  shared with you.

I want you to generate test cases only for the given story and description, pull request code that will be shared , take reference from all the documents shared but limit output only to specific story context only, donot get deviated from context of specific user story, description and pull request code.
Output will be generated properly.
